Web App using vanilla Javascript and linked to Google Books API.

Description:
I used the google books api to create a web app that allows a user to track their reading progress on multiple books at once.The app tracks percentage complete, pages left and automatically moves a book from a users booklist to a completed list when finished. Arrays that hold search results, book list, completed books and the DOM are continuously updated throughout this process.

In my code I have created a few custom methods and query selectors to make the development process easier and cleaner. My plan is to continue working on this web app and eventually learn how to get it set up to save user data to a database using mean full stack development since this solely uses javascript and I don't want to stray from the language yet.

I have left some separator comments in my code that helped me follow the flow of the projects global elements. I know that in a live website you don't want to have these or any comments in your code but I thought it might help someone viewering my code.

Please let me know what you think!
